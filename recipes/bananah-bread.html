    <h2>The wonderful world of bananah's and bread</h2>
    <p>Bananah bread is a wonderful dish that brings many people back to their childhood,
        I know it does for me anyway. Living in the south specifically, my mother used to make
        this dish a lot. It always feels like home.

    <ul>
        <li>2 or 3 ripe bananahs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Baking soda</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>1 Large egg</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <div>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C), and butter a 4x8-inch loaf pan.</li>
        </div>
        <div>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into
                the
                mashed bananas.</li>
        </div>
        <div>
            <li>Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.
            </li>
        </div>
        <div>
            <li>Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour at 350째F (175째C), or until a
                toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks
                of
                wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the
                loaf
                with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked..</li>
        </div>
        <div>
            <li>Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan
                and
                let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't
                crumbly.)

                Wrapped well, the banana bread will keep at room temperature for 4 days. For longer storage, refrigerate
                the
                loaf up to 5 days, or freeze it.</li>
        </div>
    </ol>
